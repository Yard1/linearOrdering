## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Added an URL and an ISBN number to references in DESCRIPTION.
* Standardized the reference format in documentation.

### Previous resubmission:
* Fixed the LICENSE file to conform to CRAN requirements.
* Fixed a typo in the name of the `standarized_sums` function (and updated DESCRIPTION/README).

## Test environments
* Linux Mint 18.3 Sylvia local install, R 3.6.1
* Ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.1
* check_win (devel and release)
* rhub

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.
